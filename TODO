[x] use IntFlag instead of our custom int enum
[x] experiment with Generic[Atom, V] as base class for Member -> won't be zero cost
[x] use pyi for all standard members (Instance may be a bit of a pain...)
    but Typed should work and maybe even ForwardTyped, container with nested members may
    up to a point
[x] fix tests for keyword only argument
[x] use typing.List/Dict/Set again since otherwise mypy complain on list[] in pyi file
    (while it accepts the |)
[x] use Generic aliases on Python 3.9+
[x] add type validation to Constant and ReadOnly, and update typing
